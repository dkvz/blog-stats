# Blog statistics and stuff

I actually don't do anything with my blog stats. At all. Nothing.

I started this project to try and find a relation between the word count of my articles and their length in character count as an overcomplicated math problem when I could just have the backend count words and cache that value in database.

As always, doing useless things to learn. Although, aren't all the things we do useless to the course of time and the universe?
